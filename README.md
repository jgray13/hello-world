# hello-world
My first GitHub repository. 

My name is Jen. I have been studying front-end web development for three years. 

I work with HTML, CSS and javaScript. I've spent a little time learning PHP so far. 

I have a background in SEO and try to incorporate a responsive design within my projects. 

During my studies, I have gained some free-lance work building and maintaining websites. This has been very useful for my studying as I find working on real projects a great way to learn.
