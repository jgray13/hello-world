This is my first GitHub repository!

My introduction -

My name is Jen. I am a self-taught front end web developer, with a background in SEO. I began studying web development in August 2017.

I focused on studying HTML and CSS to begin with, then moved onto learning javaScript in 2019. More recently, I have been studying PHP which has given me an insight into back end web development.

My preferred programming language is javaScript, and I would place myself at an intermediate level with js. Although it is challenging at times, javaScript is very useful for many development tasks and I enjoy learning the language. I am confident working with HTML and CSS as I have gained experience from creating projects and building sites with HTML and CSS. 

During my studies, I have gained some freelance work building and maintaining websites. This experience has been very useful for my development as I find working on real projects a great way to learn.

Before I began studying web development, I worked in online marketing for a gaming company for approximately three years. My main role was in Search Engine Optimization, and I also worked on social media marketing. Being familiar with SEO has been useful for my work in web development as I incorporate a responsive design as I build sites or work on projects.
