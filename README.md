My introduction -

My name is Jen. I began studying front-end web development in August 2017. 

I work with HTML, CSS and javaScript. I've also spent some time learning PHP. My preferred programming language is javaScript, I would place myself at an intermediate level with js. Although it is challenging at times, javaScript is very useful for many development tasks and I enjoy learning the language. I am confident working with HTML and CSS as I have gained experience from creating projects and building sites with HTML and CSS. 

I have a background in SEO, which is useful for my work in web deveopment as I try to incorporate a responsive design as I build sites or work on projects. 

During my studies, I have gained some freelance work building and maintaining websites. This experience has been very useful for my development as I find working on real projects a great way to learn.
