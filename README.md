This is my first GitHub repository!

My introduction:

My name is Jen. I am a self-taught front end web developer, with a background in SEO. I also have a keen interest in computing and information technology in general.

I began studying front end web development in August 2017. To begin with, I focused on studying HTML and CSS, then moved onto learning JavaScript in 2019. More recently, I have been studying PHP which has given me an insight into back end web development.

My preferred programming language is JavaScript, and I would place myself at an intermediate level with js. Although it is challenging at times, JavaScript is very useful for many development tasks and I enjoy learning the language. I am confident working with HTML and CSS as I have gained experience from creating projects and building sites with HTML and CSS. 

During my studies, I have gained some freelance work building and maintaining websites. This experience has been very useful for my development as I find working on real projects a great way to learn.

Before I started web development, I worked in digital marketing. I was employed by an online gaming platform for approximately three years, where my main role was in search engine optimization, and I also worked on social media marketing. Being familiar with SEO has been useful for my work in web development as I aim to optimize websites for search engines and the web as I build them, and I incorporate a responsive design as I work on projects.
